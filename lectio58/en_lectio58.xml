            The article which is treated, namely, 
            the article of the most sacred and blessed Trinity
            is the principal and fundamental article of the christian religion. 
            
            For though the ancient philosophers and some sects are in agreement with some articles, 
            nevertheless they disagree with respect to this article.
            
            It is the principal article because from this article 
            other articles draw their origin, 
            such as the article of the incarnation and many others, 
            and from this article the sacraments draw their efficacy and their merit, 
            therefore regarding this article there should be a special focus.
            
            And in this matter the entire difficulty resolves to one point, 
            namely, how can the plurality of persons stand with the simplicity of the divine 
            essence. 
            
            And all doctors treating this matter are particularly focused on this question.

            arguing against the opinion of <name xml:id="l58-Nd1e170">Anaxagoras</name>,
            who posited and infinity of principles, 
            says that the infinite qua infinite is unknown. 
            
            And from this fact it is held that the properties of the divine essence,
            insofar as this essence is infinite, 
            are unknown.
            
            And this is true with respect to intellectual creatures 
            because our eye or our intellect 
            is being oriented toward the greatest secret of nature, 
            namely to God, just as the eye of an owl is oriented toward the light of the sun.
            
            With respect to the third cause of erring
            one is persuaded by the philosopher, himself having been sufficiently elevated, <!-- transl review needed here -->
            that in the matter of the Trinity 
            one should speak without any presumption, 
            but instead with every humility, 
            as <name>Augustine</name> says.
            
            For if there were some effective cause 
            and finite producible effects were precisely known from it, 
            nevertheless it should not be denied by a philosopher that <!-- transl review needed -->
            <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> and <c>c</c> would be able to produce effects.  
            
            And therefore a philosopher would at least be reduced to this 
            that he would not have to deny that the divine essence is in three supposites 
            and that the divine essence is the subsistence of three supposites , 
            and that the article is not evidently impossible. 
            
            And it is necessary to establish and make plausible and article of this type 
            and briefly the simplicity of the divine essence should most especially be insisted upon.

            Therefore, 
            while continuing the matter about divine duration,
            and I add something here about the divine ability to be in place,
            there are three things that should be known about 
            the nature of divine eternity and duration.
          </p>
          <!-- this list of three follows ripa very closely:

          <p xml:id="l58-peqane">
            The first is that eternity does not the measure of something with potentiality. 
            This is to say that it does not measure something that is able to not be.
            Rather it is a measure of that which is actually, necessarily, existing.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="l58-sdrish">
            The second thing regarding the nature of eternity is that it is a universal measure. 
            This means that it measures how it is intrinsically or is able to be, 
            and whatever is able to be in it intrinsically, 
            and how a thing would be able to be disposed intrinsically.

            <!-- ripa vat ms, folio 148v for parallel -->
            The third thing regarding the nature of eternity is that 
            in the genus of measures it is first effectively, productively, 
            and absolutely first before any other measure.

              in some way before time or after time

              But, on account of our weakness, 
              it is permitted to say about God that he will be or that he was, 
              nevertheless, properly speaking,

            </p>
            <p xml:id="l58-scanfp">
              But against this it is argued because, 
              if God were to have this priority with respect to time, 
              with a part before and a part after,
              then by the strength of this priority 
              he would be able to make it such that 
              the world never would have been created. 
              For if eternity precedes the world, 
              and is also now, 
              then it would follow also 
              that his causality and freedom precede the world, 
              and thus it would be possible for the world 
              never to have been produced.

              where he asks:
              whether God would be able to restore a virgin 
              such that she was never corrupted.
              Et this should not be understood 
              in such a way that he would be able 
              to give natural and equally perfect gifts,

              but merely whether he would be able to restore
              a virgin such that he was never corrupted.

              maintains the opposite, 
              it is said that he is not able to do so.
              For even though God is in the same mode 
              now as he was before,
              because the matter is transitory
              and therefore 
              the matter which is present
              quickly flows into the past, 
              this implies the necessity of the corruption, 
              and thus it is not because of a defect 
              on the part of the divine power 
              but from the opposition 
              and incompatibility of things.

              that the supposite also in its personal existence

              For though there is there a distinction of supposites, 
              nevertheless there is an identity of perfection

              And this the person in its personal existence is formally eternity,

              therefore it is not immediately measured by eternity, 
              but mediately

              Nevertheless <ref>I held elsewhere</ref>
              that the person does indicate a perfection absolutely,

              It also follows that

              From this it is clear the reason why the word of God, 
              though it has been produced, 
              nevertheless is always being produced. 
              The reason is the divine perfection and measure of eternity.

              For though in the production of the creature

              Nevertheless it should further 
              be known that, 
              though we speak thus by calling eternity a measure, 
              nevertheless eternity 
              itself <!-- a parte rei --> is nothing other than the immeasurable God,

              these predicates are imposed on account of our mode of conceiving, 
              because we conceive him as existing 
              we call him eternal, 
              and there is no diversity there
              except with respect to our mode of conceiving. 
              Therefore eternity indicates nothing 
              except that God is the most purest act 
              encompassing all perfection and infinity,
              and necessarily excluding all potentiality for acquiring or losing something, 
              such that we consider him an act for which it is repugnant <!-- contradictory --> to acquire or lose, 
              namely for acquiring or losing some kind of perfection,
              and just as he is the fullness of all perfection,

              The first proposition is 
              that by however much the spiritual creature is more perfect 
              by the same degree they are able to occupy a greater amount of place. 
              because, regarding the corporeal, 
              it is not necessary that it occupy place unless according to its quantity,
              and according to what is fitting to the beauty of the universe.
              one thing is greater than another, 
              as the earth is greater than a human being
              and nevertheless a human being is more perfect, 
              therefore I speak about spiritual, 
              for just as the spiritual creature more greatly imitates God 
              in its essential perfection, so also in its occupation of space.
            </p>

              From which it follows 
              that if the highest creatable intelligence were supposed,
              then this would occupy the finite space beyond the heavens.
              For if the occupation of place is part of its essential perfection,
              then, when this is infinite, 
              it would occupy infinite place.

              But it might be asked 
              whether the spiritual creature 
              under however much place would be able to be situated.
              For which it should be imagined 
              that any creature determines for itself its quantity of place which it occupies
              according to the quantity of its own essential perfection,
              nevertheless it is possible from the absolute power of God to be situated in a greater or lesser amount of space 
              because it seems unlikely that  
              the human soul would be able to be situated in some small part of the body, 
              such that if a human being were produced successively, 
              then the soul would first inform a small part, 
              and in this way, it seems unlikely that  
              that it would be ale to occupy an infinitely small part.
