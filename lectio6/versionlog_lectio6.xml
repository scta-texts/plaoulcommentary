          <p>This is the first public version of this text. It is a first draft intially created from a reading of the reims and vatican transcription. Descriptive transcriptions of the sorbonne and st. victor transcriptions have been added. Corrections and additions will be made to the entire text after a collation comparison of all available manuscript witnesses. A draft apparatus has been made but the variants from the Sorbonne and St. Victor transcriptions need to be added. Difficult transcriptions have been marked as unclear. Name and title have been give ref attributes. Image coordinates have been added to the corresponding manuscript transcription. Citations and cross-references still need to be added.</p>
