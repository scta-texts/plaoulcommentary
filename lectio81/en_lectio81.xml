            As a declaration of the matter of charity, 
            which affects the whole theological process, 
            as attested by our savior 
            that 
            <quote xml:id="l81-Qafhugy">

            one proposition is posited 
            when beginning first from generations 
            which is this: 
            that although the gift of created charity 
            is not absolutely necessary for the pilgrim
            for reaching salvation, 
            nevertheless according to the 
            established course of the law 
            it is required that this charity 
            concur <!-- be active/operate -->
            in three types of causes
            and in the kingdom of the mind 
            this is principally influxive 
            and essentially required for operating virtuously.

              The first part is proved 
              when understanding that any form united to its subject 
              is united as a mover <!-- mover for both motrix vel motor --> 
              and as united 
              as act inhering with respect to the disposition of the form 
              to its subject as mover, 
              nevertheless it happens that God is able to supply its causality, 
              for every operation of love 
              reduces to the genus of efficient cause. 
              Whence the Holy Spirit 
              alone suffices to incline the soul 
              to operate meritoriously. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="l81-sssspa">
              In the second place, 
              the Holy Spirit alone is able to produce the act, 
              which is immediately produced from the mind 
              with mediating charity, 
              therefore with respect to the total causality 
              which charity would have with respect to the soul
              the Holy Spirit alone would suffice, 
              therefore from the part of the actions 
              the created gift is not necessary 
              since it is able to be supplied  
              through the Holy Spirit.

              In the third place, 
              divine acceptance, 
              which is an interior act, 
              is said to be a sufficient cause for this 
              namely that the creature reach salvation,
              because by the fact that 
              God wills that a creature be worthy of eternal life, 
              it is by that fact worthy. 
              But the will of God 
              does not depend on a created quality, 
              nor does is it co-bound with some quality,
              since it is sufficient by itself 
              to make a creature worthy. 
              Therefore the Holy Spirit by itself 
              and by its own will is able to accept a creature, 
              and having been so disposed 
              this will be sufficient for the pursuit of salvation.

              In the fourth place, 
              before the determination of the church, 
              namely before it would be determined 
              that in baptism three gifts would be infused, 
              namely faith, hope and love, 
              it was not evidently deduced from scripture 
              that there is another charity besides the Holy Spirit.
              Therefore according to the process of Scripture 
              there appear to be many authorities to the contrary, 
              namely, that no gift is created, 
              indeed there was the Holy Spirit, 
              who operated all meritorious things in creatures,

                though perhaps one being reckless would be able to deny accidents, 
                nevertheless these should be conceded for substances and their operation, 
                therefore the soul will have proportional habits

                as it appears in natural things from substantial form, 
                which has many accidents,

                and acts of loving God and neighbor 
                more noble habits and acts co-acting meritorious works

                  Finally, 
                  it is proved 
                  that charity is the genus of the efficient cause.
                  This is clear 
                  because, 
                  just as acts formally generate habits, 
                  so habits concur actively in the generation of acts similar to the first acts.
                  In this mode 
                  acts generate habits in natural things, 
                  and conversely, 
                  therefore from charity 
                  habits are generated 
                  and from these habits 
                  are generated acts similar to the first. 
                  Consequently, 
                  charity concurs 
                  actively with respect to meritorious acts.

                  In the second place,

                  therefore 
                  in the same place 
                  the concurrence of a supernatural cause is needed, 
                  namely of charity,
                  because if it were to concur precisely

                  but were only to assist with the appearance <!-- decorem --> of the soul, 
                  then this would seem to be in concord with

                  does deny that charity helps the soul in the execution of its works, 
                  nevertheless he concedes that the soul without charity 
                  is able to do meritorious work.
                  But if it is posited 
                  that charity concurs actively, 
                  it follows that it will help the soul with respect to meritorious work,

              because, 
              though they have a little bit of charity, 
              nevertheless a difficulty prevails from concupiscence,

              and in this

              In the seventh place, 
              it follows that for any rule 
              charity is the most fitting disposition. 
              This is clear because for the rule of the kingdom of the soul
              this is most sufficient 
              and contains all the virtues 
              which restrain all passions. 
              It is also sufficient for the political rule, 
              in the first place 
              because it is able to rule the kingdom of the mind
              when it is in some creature, 
              he is well suited for political rule,
              <!-- V: since one is able to rule himself well he is worthy of ruling -->
              and because 
              charity does not ask 
              which things belong to itself 
              and which things belong to its neighbor.
              Therefore this is most fitting for rule 
              because it most greatly excludes tyranny, 
              for the tyrant
              does not rule on account of the political good, 
              but on account of 
              <pb ed="#SV" n="298-v"/>
              <cb ed="#SV" n="a"/>
              its own private good.
              And therefore charity is the most fitting disposition 
              for ruling, 
              not only the mind,
              but political matters, 
              and thus charity is able to 
              be applied both to spiritual and temporal rule.

              This is clear

            since the Holy Spirit always directs charity
